filter_graph.py

This script filters graphs based on user-defined rules involving the sum of degrees
of nodes at each edge. It reads graphs in graph6 format from standard input, checks
each graph against a list of rules provided as a JSON string, and prints only the
graphs that satisfy all the rules.

Each rule specifies:
    - "degree_sum": the target sum of degrees of two connected nodes
    - "type": one of "min", "max", or "exactly"
    - "count": how many such edges are required

Usage:
    python filter_graph.py '<filter_string>'

Example:
    python filter_graph.py '[{"degree_sum": 6, "type": "min", "count": 3}]'
    This keeps only graphs with at least 3 edges where the endpoints have degrees summing to 6.

    Parses the filter string into a Python object (dictionary or list) based on the JSON format.

    Args:

        list or dict: A Python object representing the parsed rules.

        SystemExit: If the `rule_str` is not valid JSON, the function prints an error message

        degrees (dict): A dictionary mapping node IDs to their respective degrees in the graph.
